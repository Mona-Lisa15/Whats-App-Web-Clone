This project was created using Create React App(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Scripts You Can Run

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start

Starts the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to see it in your browser.

The page reloads automatically when you make changes.
You may also see lint errors in the console.

npm test

Runs the test watcher in interactive mode.
Learn more about running tests(https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/).

npm run build

Builds the app for production in the build folder.
This bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.
Your app will be ready to deploy!(https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)

Learn more about deployment.

npm run eject

Warning: This is irreversible. Once you eject, you can't undo it.

Ejecting gives you full control over the project setup, copying all configuration files and dependencies like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint directly into your project.

While all commands will still work, they now use your customized scripts. You should only eject if you need a highly customized setup.
